# BookIt
# Have you ever tried to set up a meeting, but had to go through a long and tedious email chain to do so? This website, called BookIt!, aims to solve that issue.
# BookIt! uses the Google Calendar API to automatically find an open time slot in your calendar in business hours, and set up a new meeting.
